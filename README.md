# WhatsApp Bot (JavaScript)

This is a JavaScript-based WhatsApp bot that performs various functions in response to specific commands. Here's a brief description of what the code does:

## Main Features

1. **Help Command**: Easily retrieve a list of available commands by sending `!Help`.

2. **Ping Pong Command**: Test the service's responsiveness with the `!ping` command, and the bot will respond with `pong`.

3. **Google Search Command**: Initiate a Google search within WhatsApp by using commands such as `!google` or `!Google`. The bot will send a screenshot of the search results.

4. **Youtube Search Command**: Search for YouTube videos directly in WhatsApp with the `!YoutubeSearch` command. Receive titles and links of the search results, along with a screenshot of the first page.

5. **Youtube Download Command**: Download YouTube videos using the `!YoutubeDownload` command, and the bot will send the downloaded video as a message.

6. **Meme Command**: Lighten the mood with the `!Meme` command, which fetches a random meme from 'meme-api.herokuapp.com' and shares it in the chat.

7. **Joke Command**: Enjoy a good laugh with the `!Joke` command. The bot fetches jokes from the 'jokeapi.dev' API and sends them in two parts, setup and delivery, as separate messages.

These features are powered by various libraries, including 'puppeteer,' 'axios,' and 'whatsapp-web.js,' enabling the bot to interact with WhatsApp and provide a range of functionalities.
